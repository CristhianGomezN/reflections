What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    It creates a file name .git, it's necessary because without that I just have another folder that don't save my history
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    Staging area is non an area that you could edit, is just a path. It could offer a lot of control on the repository
