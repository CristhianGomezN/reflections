When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to work with other people or to share my work
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because it allows more control, I could pull changes just when I think is necessary or when I have finished an upgrade
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  forks are clones on github, clones are clones on my pc, branches are make on repositories. I would make a fork when I want to    clone edit without permissions, clones when I want to get repositories on disk and branches when I am working and want to test something or to work non on my main thing
