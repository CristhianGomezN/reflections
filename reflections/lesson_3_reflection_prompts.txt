When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to work with other people or to share my work
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because it allows more control, I could pull changes just when I think is necessary or when I have finished an upgrade
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  forks are clones on github, clones are clones on my pc, branches are make on repositories. I would make a fork when I want to    clone edit without permissions, clones when I want to get repositories on disk and branches when I am working and want to test something or to work non on my main thing
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  the benefit is that you could compare and keep track with the things that other users do or that you do on another machine without editing your actual archive on your own computer
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  with drives, dropbox or things like that, that would be incredible tedious,
  because all the time I will have to notify people and ask for the things that they have made,
  in addition I wouldn't have all my versions.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
    When I just want to try something or to make any change that could crash everything
