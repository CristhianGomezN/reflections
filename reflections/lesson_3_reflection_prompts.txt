When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to work with other people or to share my work
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because it allows more control, I could pull changes just when I think is necessary or when I have finished an upgrade
